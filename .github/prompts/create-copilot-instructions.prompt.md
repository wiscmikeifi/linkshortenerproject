Take the information below and generate a [NAME].instructions .md file for it in the /.github/instructions directory.  If a .md filename is provided, use that, otherwise generate an appropriate name for the [NAME] placeholder based on the generated content. Make sure the instructions are concise and not too long. If no information is provided below, prompt the user to give the necessary details about the layer of architecture or coding standards to document. The .md file should have frontmatter with a description property that informs copilot of when to use this set of instructions.
